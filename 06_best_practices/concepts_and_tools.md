## Testing the code: unit test with pytest
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is a framework that makes building simple and scalable test cases easy. It is widely used for writing unit tests in Python.

Example:
```bash
pytest test_your_script.py
```

## Integration tests with docker-compose
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It can be used to run integration tests by setting up the necessary services and dependencies.

Example:
```bash
docker-compose up --abort-on-container-exit
```

## Testing cloud services with Localstack

## Code quality: linting and formatting

### Black
[Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an uncompromising Python code formatter. It reformats entire files in place, ensuring consistent style.

Example:
```bash
black your_script.py
```

### Pylint
[Pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a comprehensive source code analyzer for Python. It looks for programming errors, helps enforce a coding standard, and sniffs for code smells.

Example:
```bash
pylint your_script.py
```

### isort
[isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) is a Python utility for sorting imports. It helps to sort and format imports in a consistent manner.

Example:
```bash
isort your_script.py
```

## Git pre-commit hooks
[Pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) are scripts that run automatically before a commit is made. They help enforce code quality and catch issues early in the development process.

Example:
```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Makefiles
[Makefiles](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) are used to define a set of tasks to be executed. They are commonly used to automate workflows such as building, testing, and deploying code.

Example:
```makefile
test:
    pytest tests/

format:
    black . && isort .
```
Run a specific task:
```bash
make test
```

## Staging and production environments
Staging and production environments are separate setups used to test and deploy applications. Staging mimics production to catch issues before deployment, while production is the live environment.

Example:
```bash
# Deploy to staging
kubectl apply -f staging-deployment.yaml

# Deploy to production
kubectl apply -f production-deployment.yaml
```

## Infrastructure as Code
[Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) involves managing and provisioning infrastructure using code. Tools like Terraform and AWS CloudFormation are commonly used for this purpose.

Example with Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

## CI/CD and GitHub Actions
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) is a CI/CD platform that automates workflows directly from your GitHub repository. It can be used to build, test, and deploy applications.

Example workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```
